Simple budget planning app.

This project is a simple budget management application built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite. The app allows users to create budget templates, track their earnings and expenses, and manage their monthly budgets through a calendar interface. All data is stored in local storage by default, but the app is designed to be flexible, allowing you to connect your own API for data retrieval and updates.

Features
Create Budget Templates:
Users can create a budget template that includes their expected earnings and expenses. This template can be reused across different months to simplify budget management.

Monthly Budget Management:
The app provides a calendar interface where users can create and manage their monthly budgets based on the budget template. Each month can be customized, allowing users to adjust their budgets as needed.

Data Storage:
By default, all data is stored in the browser's local storage. However, the app is designed with flexibility in mind, enabling you to connect to an external API for data storage and retrieval.

Project Setup
This project is built using Vue 3 with the <script setup> syntax and TypeScript. The build process is powered by Vite, which provides fast and optimized development and build environments.
